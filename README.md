# Marketing-Mix-Modeling

A marketing mix model is a modeling technique used to determine market attribution, the estimated impact of each marketing channel company uses.

Unlike attribution modeling, another technique used for marketing attribution, marketing mix models measure the approximate impact of your marketing channels, like TV, radio, and newspapers.

Generally, your output variable will be sales or conversions, but it can also be things like website traffic. Your input variables typically consist of marketing spend by channel by period (day, week, month, quarter, etcâ€¦)

Attribution modeling, also known as channel attribution modeling, is the process of assigning credit to various marketing channels or touchpoints that have contributed to a user's conversion or action (known as an event)
